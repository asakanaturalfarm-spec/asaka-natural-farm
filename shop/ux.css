==============================================
ARCHIVED: ux.css (Integrated into style.css)
==============================================

This file has been integrated into style.css to unify styling and reduce duplication.
The color variables, font definitions, and component styles have been merged into
the main stylesheet, which is now the single source of truth for styling.

To reference original ux.css content, see git history or the initial backup.
All styles are now in: style.css

Key integrations:
- @font-face (JTC 民芸文字) moved to style.css
- Color variables (:root) merged and normalized
- Navbar, Hero, Features, Products, Evidence sections updated
- Button styles unified (--main-green instead of --primary-color where applicable)
- Responsive breakpoints and media queries preserved

HTML files still reference style.css and ux.css for compatibility,
but ux.css is no longer modified. Use style.css for all future updates.
